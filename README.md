# Foreground Segmentation for Images with Uniform Background

This module was developed as part of [marooner](https://github.com/amberm291/marooner-final). This module extarcts the background from an image with a uniform background, by converting the entire background to a RGB value of `(0,0,0)`. For an input image like this 

![clean input](images/input.jpg)

it gives output as

![result image](images/result.png)
